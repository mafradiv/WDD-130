        Why will people come to your site?
There is a great deal of people in the world who do not have enough money 
to afford any kind of education. They do not have the resources and 
they may have one cellphone and scarce access to internet. They may use 
the access of any public place where internet access is granted but not a place 
where you pay money but literally a public place like a park or 
the avenue or a library. They only have a cellphone. They want to learn English. 
There are thousands of videos on YouTube where they find explanations, 
but the explanations are in English, and they do not understand it. 
There are another number of tutorials in Spanish and castellano. 
They also teach English, but They are not helping the students since 
they are giving explanations in castellano to understand English relying on 
translation as a main way to acquire English. English Is the main language on 
the web and There are numberless of websites created to learn English. 
They are helping a lot of people with some background on education but there is 
still a number of people who do not have access to these resources because 
they were not trained in learning even in their own language. They will come 
to this website because the very first steps they need to give. They will find it
here and they will also find sources it will help them to understand other 
learning pages. Word will not be the main way of communicating on this website 
but photos. 
What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
The very first steps to understand the very basic vocabulary to understand 
English. They will come and see they need to follow certain steps and 
they can use what they previously learned in this page to understand 
the following. The first question they will answer here is what do I need 
to understand? I need to focus on the meaning, the pronunciation, and 
the use of a word in the target language and how to use that word in a sentence 
to convey meaning and not the translation. They will discover that translation is
mechanical. They can do it but mentally and they will focus on reinforcing 
the target language.
What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
They will find the first steps previous to understand more complicated activities in their learning journey. 
What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
They are going to click in the correct answer to continue to the next activity
Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this 
information or complete the actions?
The other resources they find they are great, but they are not designed to this 
group of people. They may be good and help until a certain point, but 
they are not helpful at the very beginning. This website is going to help 
the user on how to begin and then it will give them options to recommend others 
about where to start. There is a good number of websites they offer great 
activities but one of the challenges a very low-level student face is 
they do not understand the vocabulary in the very basic exercise they intend 
to complete. This is why many institutions that teach English as a 
second language try to begin with a pre basic class, but it is not profitable 
for them because the people who need this class do not have the money 
to afford it. This website will help them. Question I have is how can 
this website be afforded so it can benefit the students and it can be profitable?
