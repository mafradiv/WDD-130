                <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for <em>relaxing</em>. 
                That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.
                Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and 
                notice the <strong>beauty</strong> that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>
