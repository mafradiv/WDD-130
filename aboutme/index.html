    <p>My name is Marco Diaz, I already earned two certificates. <br> 
        One in Entrepreneurship and TESOL since I teach English <br>
        I started with a declared major in Business but I have been enjoying technology. <br> 
    </p>
    <p>I love reading, cooking, running, traveling, dancing, listening to music and <br> 
        spending time with my wife and kids. </p>
    <p>I am an English Teacher. It was my dream job. <br> 
        After the things I am learning now I am excited about what it is going to happen, I have no idea. <br> 
        </p>
    <p>Right now I am trying to get my AAS for now. <br> 
        Later will come the bachelor and something on programming. <br>
        </p>
        <p>I really love BYU-Idaho since it is giving me the chance to continue my education. <br>
            Web design is something that I always wanted to learned when I witnessed how the first computers came to Peru. <br>
        </p>
    <p>I am thankful to BYU-Idaho for making it possible. <br>
        I am going to learn this to be able to interact in a better way <br>
        with the world and serve others in a better way. <br>
        this has become a reality for everybody where technology plays an important part. <br>
        </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for over 35 years. <br>
        There is a phrase I remember reading in an old book about history of the church. <br> 
        It reads: "The church has never attracted prominent men. It has created them". <br>
        There is one scripture I love a lot. D&C 4:5 "faith, hope, charity and love, <br>
        with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work"</p>
